**Purpose:** Standardized interface for all compliance controls  
**Location:** `safelayer/guards/base.py`  
**Key Methods:**
- `check(text)`: Detection and classification of policy violations
- `mask(text)`: Sanitization and redaction of non-compliant content
- `explain_action(details)`: Audit-friendly explanation of actions taken

#### 2. Built-in Compliance Guards

## Security Architecture

### Threat Model

#### Mitigated Threats
1. **Data Exfiltration:** PII detection prevents sensitive data leakage
2. **Prompt Injection:** Content filtering blocks malicious inputs
3. **Model Poisoning:** Guardrails prevent harmful training data
4. **Privacy Violations:** Automatic redaction maintains confidentiality
5. **Regulatory Non-compliance:** Built-in policy enforcement

#### Security Controls

##### Input Validation
```python
# Example: Multi-layer validation
from safelayer.guards import PIIGuard, ToneGuard
from safelayer.manager import GuardManager

# Defense in depth configuration
guards = [
    PIIGuard(mode='strict', log_violations=True),
    ToneGuard(sensitivity='high', block_toxic=True),
    CustomComplianceGuard(industry='healthcare')
]

manager = GuardManager(guards, fail_fast=True)
```

##### Audit Trail Integrity
```python
# Cryptographically signed audit entries
from safelayer.audit import AuditLogger

logger = AuditLogger(
    signing_key='production_key',
    storage_backend='encrypted_database',
    retention_policy='7_years'
)
```

## Integration Patterns for Regulated Environments

### 1. API Gateway Integration
```python
# Pre-processing layer for all AI requests
from safelayer.decorators import apply_guards

@apply_guards(compliance_manager)
def process_ai_request(user_input, user_context):
    # Request automatically sanitized before AI processing
    return ai_model.generate_response(user_input)
```

### 2. Agent Framework Integration
```python
# Tool call sanitization
from safelayer.manager import GuardManager

class ComplianceAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.guard_manager = GuardManager([
            PIIGuard(), ToneGuard(), IndustrySpecificGuard()
        ])
    
    def execute_tool(self, tool_input):
        # Sanitize before tool execution
        safe_input = self.guard_manager.run(tool_input)
        return self.tool_executor.run(safe_input)
```

### 3. Batch Processing Pipeline
```python
# High-volume compliance processing
from safelayer.batch import BatchProcessor

processor = BatchProcessor(
    guards=[PIIGuard(), ToneGuard()],
    parallel_workers=4,
    audit_enabled=True,
    error_handling='quarantine'
)

processor.process_documents(document_batch)
```

## Audit & Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Violation Detection:** Immediate alerts for policy breaches
- **Performance Metrics:** Processing latency and throughput tracking
- **System Health:** Guard availability and error rates
- **User Behavior:** Access patterns and usage analytics

### Compliance Reporting

#### Standard Reports
1. **Data Processing Activity Report** (GDPR Art. 30)
2. **Security Incident Summary** (ISO 27001)
3. **Policy Violation Dashboard** (Internal compliance)
4. **User Access Audit** (SOX compliance)

#### Custom Report Generation
```python
from safelayer.reporting import ComplianceReporter

reporter = ComplianceReporter()
report = reporter.generate_report(
    type='gdpr_processing_activities',
    date_range='last_quarter',
    format='official_template'
)
```

## Deployment Considerations for Regulated Environments

### High-Availability Configuration
```python
# Production deployment with redundancy
from safelayer.cluster import GuardCluster

cluster = GuardCluster(
    nodes=['guard-node-1', 'guard-node-2', 'guard-node-3'],
    consensus_mode='byzantine_fault_tolerant',
    audit_replication='synchronous'
)
```

### Data Residency & Sovereignty
- **Regional Deployment:** Guards can be deployed in specific jurisdictions
- **Data Localization:** Processing and audit logs remain within borders
- **Cross-Border Compliance:** Automated data transfer impact assessments

### Backup & Recovery
```python
# Disaster recovery configuration
from safelayer.backup import BackupManager

backup_manager = BackupManager(
    schedule='hourly',
    encryption='AES-256',
    location='multiple_regions',
    integrity_checks='continuous'
)
```
